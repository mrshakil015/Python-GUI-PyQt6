The authors define data poisoning attacks as \"any attack that modifies the training data in order to cause a model to make incorrect predictions.\" They then discuss a variety of different data poisoning attacks, including:\n\n* Label flipping: In this attack, the attacker modifies the labels of some of the training data in order to cause the model to learn incorrect associations between features and labels.\n* Feature poisoning: In this attack, the attacker modifies the features of some of the training data in order to cause the model to learn incorrect associations between features and labels.\n* Data reconstruction: In this attack, the attacker generates new training data that is specifically designed to cause the model to make incorrect predictions.\n\nThe authors also discuss a number of defenses against data poisoning attacks, including:\n\n* Data sanitization: This involves removing or correcting any malicious data from the training set.\n* Model robustness: This involves making the model less sensitive to changes in the training data.\n* Adversarial training: This involves training the model on data that has been artificially corrupted in order to make it more robust to poisoning attacks.\n\nThe authors conclude by discussing the challenges of defending against data poisoning attacks and the need for further research in this area.\n\nThis paper is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about data poisoning attacks and the defenses against them.

It allows our bodies to rest and repair themselves, and it helps us to function properly both physically and mentally. When we don't get enough sleep, we can experience a range of problems, including fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and impaired decision-making.\n\nIn the long term, chronic sleep deprivation can increase our risk of developing serious health problems, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. It can also lead to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nFor most adults, the recommended amount of sleep is around 7-8 hours per night. However, some people may need more or less sleep, depending on their individual needs. If you're not sure how much sleep you need, try to experiment until you find the amount that leaves you feeling refreshed and alert during the day.\n\nThere are a number of things you can do to improve your sleep habits, including:\n\n* Stick to a regular sleep schedule and go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends.\n* Create a relaxing bedtime routine to help you wind down before bed.\n* Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n* Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n* Get regular exercise, but not too close to bedtime.\n* See a doctor if you have trouble sleeping.\n\nGetting enough sleep is essential for our health and well-being. By following these tips, you can improve your sleep habits and enjoy all the benefits that come with a good night's sleep.", "pdf_info": null}]}, {"title": "Attached File: Rotten Fruits Paper  Review.pdf\nPaper Title \n: Implementation of Deep Learning Methods to Identify Rotten Fruits. \nPaper Type \n: Conference Paper \nPublished Date : April 2021 \nDOI \n \n: 10.1109/ICOEI51242.2021.9453004 \nAuthors \n: 1) Sovon Chakroborty, 2) FM Javed Mehedi Shamrat, 3) Md.
