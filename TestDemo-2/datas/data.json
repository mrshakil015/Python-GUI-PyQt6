Alauddin,  \n4) FM Javed Mehedi Shamrat,  \n5) Md. Masum Billah, \n 6) Rumesh Ranjan \n \n \nWHY THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH? \nThe researchers in this paper developed a mask detection model using deep learning methods to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19. The model was trained on a dataset containing masked and \nunmasked images obtained from a variety of sources, including images of the coauthors captured \nusing webcams and cell phone cameras. Goal of this research is to build a model which can \naccurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask, which can be used in real-world \napplications such as public places, workplaces or hospitals.  \nPROPOSED SYSTEM \nIn this research, they proposed a system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for \ndetection face musk. The process involves data collection, data preprocessing and augmentation, \ntraining a CNN model using different architectures such as (Convolutional layer with Max pooling, \nConvolutional layer with Average pooling, and MobileNetV2), detection output, and performance \nevaluation. \nFirstly, in the data collection stage, they gather a large dataset with total 1845 images. The images \ncan be obtained from various sources. \nNext, in the data preprocessing and augmentation stage, they clean and preprocess the data to \nbe used for training the model.

Then \nresized images 128 x128 to pass the second layer of Convolutional2D and again 64 x 64 to pass \nthe third Convolutional2D layer. \n After preprocessing the data, they train a CNN model using different architectures such as \nConvolutional layer with Max Pooling, Convolutional layer with Average Pooling, and \nMobileNetV2.

In convolutional layer architecture they \nused Max pooling operation with three convolution layers, as well as the average pooling \noperation with three convolution layers. \nFirstly, Max Pooling Operation. In the proposed system, the input image is first passed through \nthree convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by a flatten operation, a fully connected \nlayer, and an output layer with softmax activation function. \nIn the first convolutional layer, the input image with a size of 256 x 256 is convolved with a set of \nlearnable filters, and applied the RELU function to the resulting feature maps. Then, the max \npooling process is performed to downsample the feature map.  \nIn the second convolutional layer, input images resized to 128 x128, the first convolutional layer \nare convolved again with a different set of filters. At the same way they applied third \nconvolutional layer. Resized images 64 x64 to pass the third Convolutional2D layer. \nAfter the three convolutional layers with max pooling, the flatten operation is applied to \ntransform the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector, which is then fed into the fully connected layer. \nThe fully connected layer is used to perform classification based on the extracted features, and \nthe output layer with softmax function used to produce the final classification results. \nFor function mapping again they used same architecture with the process of average pooling. \nAlso they used MobileNetV2 architecture for face musk detection. MobileNetV2 is a popular \nconvolutional neural network architecture for image classification tasks. The architecture is \nbased on depth wise separable convolutions, which allows for high accuracy with lower \ncomputational cost. \nEXPERIMENTED RESULT \nFor detecting face mask they used a dataset of 1845 images. The proposed model achieved \ntraining accuracy 96.49% and validation accuracy 98.49% using Max pooling operation.

Classification of rotten fruits and fresh fruits is usually carried out by humans. \nWhere it is very critical to identifying rotten fruits. It is time consuming and also increase \nproduction cost. They conducted to this research for reduce production costs, reducing human \neffort, and shorten production time.  \nPROPOSED SYSTEM \nIn this research, they proposed a system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for \ndetection face musk. The process involves data collection, data preprocessing and augmentation, \ntraining a CNN using different architectures such as Convolutional layer with Max pooling, \nConvolutional layer with Average pooling, and MobileNetV2, detection output, and performance \nevaluation. \nFirstly, in the data collection stage, they gather a large dataset with total 13599 images. The \nimages can be obtained from various sources. The dataset divided into 6 classes, which is- Fresh \nBananas, Rotten Bananas, Fresh Apples, Rotten Apples, Fresh Oranges, Rotten Oranges. \nNext, in the data preprocessing and augmentation stage, they clean and preprocess the data to \nbe used for training the model. This may involve tasks such as resizing images, removing \nirrelevant information, and normalizing the data. They normalized images 256 x 256 pixels.

In the proposed system, the input image is first passed through \nthree convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by a flatten operation, a fully connected \nlayer, and an output layer with softmax activation function. \nIn the first convolutional layer, the input image with a size of 256 x 256 is convolved with a set of \nlearnable filters, and applied the RELU function to the resulting feature maps. Then, the max \npooling process is performed to downsample the feature map.  \nIn the second convolutional layer, input images resized to 128 x128, the first convolutional layer \nare convolved again with a different set of filters. At the same way they applied third \nconvolutional layer. Resized images 64 x64 to pass the third Convolutional2D layer. \nAfter the three convolutional layers with max pooling, the flatten operation is applied to \ntransform the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector, which is then taken care of into the fully-\nconnected layer. Based on the extracted features, the fully connected layer is used to classify the \ndata, and the output layer with the softmax function is used to generate the final classification \nresults. \nFor function mapping again they used same architecture with the process of average pooling. \nAlso they used MobileNetV2 architecture for face musk detection. MobileNetV2 is a popular \nconvolutional neural network architecture for image classification tasks. The architecture is \nbased on depth wise separable convolutions, which allows for high accuracy with lower \ncomputational cost. \nEXPERIMENTED RESULT \nFor identifying rotten and fresh fruits they used a dataset of 13599 images.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively. They\nperform worse than single-drone detection when there are\nmultiple drones in the frame. We\u2019ll concentrate on several\ndrone detections in our upcoming research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Wu, W.

However, the accurate and real-time\nidentification of airplanes in aerial imagery remains a challenging\nproblem.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively. They\nperform worse than single-drone detection when there are\nmultiple drones in the frame. We\u2019ll concentrate on several\ndrone detections in our upcoming research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Wu, W.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively. They\nperform worse than single-drone detection when there are\nmultiple drones in the frame. We\u2019ll concentrate on several\ndrone detections in our upcoming research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Wu, W.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively. They\nperform worse than single-drone detection when there are\nmultiple drones in the frame. We\u2019ll concentrate on several\ndrone detections in our upcoming research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Wu, W.

However, the accurate and real-time\nidentification of airplanes in aerial imagery remains a challenging\nproblem. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive\nstudy on developing a highly accurate and efficient airplane\ndetection model using the deep learning architecture .The paper\nbegins by emphasizing the importance of airplane detection in en-\nsuring safe and efficient air travel. Accurate airplane detection is\nessential for air traffic controllers to monitor aircraft movements,\nprevent collisions, and manage busy airspace effectively. Our\ngoal is to develop a Airplane detection and tracking model that\nmaximizes accuracy while minimizing loss. In order to identify\nAirplanes, in this study we utilized VGG19, Xception, ResNet50,\nand MobileNetV2. We evaluated the accuracy and loss of the\nalgorithms using mean squared error (mse).

Each of the\n4 object detection models had its accuracy, loss, and IoU values\ntracked, and we displayed a comparison while saving the model\nthat performed the best. The Xception model was the only 1 of the\n4 that simultaneously provided the required output with the best\naccuracy and the lowest loss. The Xception model\u2019s accuracy was\n98.59% with a loss of 15.9409, which outperformed all previously\nexisting approaches. We chose the Xception model for Airplane\ndetection and tracking because of this.\nIndex Terms\u2014Airplane detection, UAV, Object detection, Xcep-\ntion, OpenCV, Computer Vision, Airplane Tracking, Deep learn-\ning, Airplane Identification\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively. They\nperform worse than single-drone detection when there are\nmultiple drones in the frame. We\u2019ll concentrate on several\ndrone detections in our upcoming research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Wu, W.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the realm of aviation, the reliable detection of airplanes\nis of paramount importance for ensuring safety, managing\nairspace, and conducting efficient surveillance operations. Air-\nplanes, as manned aircraft, serve as indispensable means of\ntransportation, trade, and defense, playing a vital role in global\nconnectivity. To maintain safe and seamless air travel, it is\nessential to develop accurate and real-time airplane detection\nsystems capable of identifying aircraft swiftly and precisely.\nAirplane detection carries critical implications for aviation\nsafety, air traffic management, and various surveillance appli-\ncations. Air traffic controllers rely on timely and accurate de-\ntection to monitor aircraft movements, prevent potential colli-\nsions, and efficiently allocate airspace resources. Additionally,\nairplane detection is instrumental in military operations, search\nand rescue missions, and disaster response efforts. Unlike\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Airplane , airplanes are\noperated by experienced pilots, posing unique challenges in\ndeveloping robust detection methodologies. Variability in air-\nplane sizes, configurations, and flight characteristics, coupled\nwith diverse environmental conditions, demands sophisticated\ndetection techniques capable of handling complex scenarios.\nThe objective of this research paper is to explore state-of-the-\nart computer vision techniques, with a particular emphasis on\ndeep learning models, to address the complexities of airplane\ndetection. Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tech-\nnology in computer vision, exhibiting remarkable capabilities\nin object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced architectures\nsuch as Xception, VGG19, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, we\nseek to design a model that maximizes accuracy while mini-\nmizing false positives and detection latency. This study aims\nto contribute to the development of an efficient and accurate\nairplane detection system that can be integrated into existing\nair traffic management systems and surveillance networks.\nSuccessful implementation of such a system can significantly\nenhance aviation safety, optimize air traffic flow, and support\ncritical operations in aviation and defense sectors. Throughout\nthe subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nemployed for airplane detection, describe the architecture and\ndesign of deep learning models utilized, present the experi-\nmental setup, and thoroughly analyze the performance of each\nmodel based on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, IoU, and\nmore. The findings from this research will provide valuable\ninsights into the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\ndeep learning models for airplane detection, thereby advancing\nthe state-of-the-art in this vital domain. Ultimately, our vision\nis to contribute to a safer and more efficient aviation ecosystem\nthrough the deployment of advanced and reliable airplane\ndetection technologies. In this paper we are using photographs,\nreal-time video, video footage to identify airplane successfully.\nAccording to research, acoustic sensors, radio frequency, radar,\nand camera sensors backed by computer vision algorithms are\nthe primary technologies that may be utilized for Airplane\ndetection.\nA. Detection of Airplane Using Acoustics\nDetection of Airplanes using acoustics is a technique that\nmakes use of microphones to find Airplanes sounds. By\nidentifying and interpreting the Airplanes\u2019 distinctive sound,\nit is possible to estimate the Airplanes\u2019 position, altitude,\nand movement direction. This technique offers a number of\nbenefits, including the capacity to identify Airplanes at night\nor in low-light situations, as well as Airplanes that are invisible\nto the unaided eye. There are various drawbacks to acoustic-\nbased Airplanes detection systems. Weather factors, including\nwind, rain, and snow, can have an influence on acoustic\nsensors, affecting the accuracy and range of the detecting\nsystem. Outside noise, such as that from industry or traffic,\ncan change the acoustic profile of Airplanes, making it more\nelusive to detect. The detection capability of acoustic sensors\nis not limited to Airplanes alone; they are also capable of\ndetecting sounds produced by small animals, birds, and flying\ninsects. There is hence a chance for false- positive detections.\nDue to the restricted acoustic sensor range, Airplanes must\nbe located near the detection system in order to be picked\nup. Since acoustic sensors are omnidirectional, they can pick\nup noises coming from any direction. Finding the Airplanes\u2019s\nlocation and its flight route may be challenging as a result.\nAcoustic sensors are capable of detecting the existence of\nAirplanes, but they are unable to offer details on the size,\nshape, or kind of the Airplane , which may restrict their utility\nin identifying and locating Airplanes.\nB. Detection of Airplanes Using Radar\nA popular method for locating and following Airplanes\nin the air is radar Airplane detection. Radars are tools that\nidentify and detect items nearby by using electromagnetic\nradiation. They send out a signal that bounces off nearby\nobjects and returns to the radar, enabling it to determine the\nobject\u2019s size, speed, and direction. In order to find Airplanes,\nradar systems are made to pick up small, low-flying objects\nwith radar cross sections that are often much smaller than those\nof aircraft. The radar cross sections, which varies based on the\nobject\u2019s size, shape, and substance, measures the capacity of\nan item to reflect radar signals. Radar can find Airplanes at\ngreat distances and in any kind of weather. Radar equipment\nmay also be used to establish the position, height, speed, and\ndirection of a Airplane that has been identified, which can\nhelp authorities assess the danger level and take the necessary\naction. . Radar systems may also be used with other security\ntools like cameras and alarms to offer a more complete security\nsolution. The detection range of a Airplane can be influenced\nby factors including geography, weather, size, and speed. Due\nto their narrow radar cross sections and propensity for false\npositives, miniature Airplanes are particularly challenging to\ndetect using radar. Once a Airplane is discovered, it might\nbe difficult to establish its precise location, especially if it is\nmoving constantly.\nC. Detection of Airplanes Using Radio Frequency\nAnother strategy for Airplane detection and tracking has\nbeen developed utilizing radio frequency (RF) technology.\nThis technology picks up the electromagnetic signals gener-\nated by Airplanes or their controllers. Similar to radar, RF\ndetection has a finite detection range and is susceptible to the\neffects of the environment, including weather and topography.\nAdditionally, if there are obstructions or interference in the\nsurroundings, RF detection\u2019s efficacy may also be diminished.\nOther electronic equipment can interfere with RF signals,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between Airplane signals and\nother signals in the vicinity.\nD. Visualized Airplane Detection\nVisualized Airplane identification uses thermal or optical\ncameras to visually identify and track Airplanes. To locate\nand track Airplanes, this technique uses image analysis from\nthe cameras\u2019 collected photos, videos, and webcam. Visual\nAirplane identification may be highly accurate when combined\nwith machine learning algorithms that can assess the images in\nreal- time to identify Airplanes. This technology is a flexible\nchoice for Airplane detection since it can be employed in a\nrange of settings and lighting situations. Due to its ability\nto precisely identify Airplanes based on their visual features,\nvisualized Airplane identification can also have a lower false-\npositive rate than other detection techniques. Our approach\nuses Airplane images, videos, webcams, and different com-\nputer vision algorithms to detect Airplanes.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nManja Wu et al. [1] employing deep learning, a real-time\ndrone detector was produced. They used a KCF tracker to\nconstruct a semi-automatic dataset to expedite the training of\nthe learned photos. The YOLOv2 deep learning model was\ndeveloped by adjusting the resolution structure of the input\nphotographs and the size parameters of the anchor box. The\nnetwork was trained using drone datasets from the University\nof Southern California and an anti-drone dataset marked\nwith a KCF tracker. The authors\u2019 recommended detector\nproduced accurate findings in real-time detection at a fair\nsystem cost.Wang et al. [2] proposed a rapid, straightforward,\nand efficient approach for unmanned aerial vehicle detection\nbased on video captured using stationary cameras. Using\nthe temporal median background removal method, moving\nobject images were detected, and global Fourier descriptors\nand local HOG features were recovered. Using the combined\nFourier descriptor (FD) and HOG features, the SVM classifier\ncarried out classification and recognition. The suggested FD\nand HOG algorithms might perform the task of classifying\nbirds and drones with greater accuracy than the GFD method,\naccording to experimental evidence provided by the authors.\nThe proposed recognition method\u2019s overall accuracy was 98%.\nAs part of the authors\u2019 deep learning-based methodology,\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used\nfor pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Two\nmethods for using motion detection and image processing to\ntrack down and follow an unmanned aerial vehicle at a distance\nof 350 feet during the day were suggested by Hamatapa et al.\n[3] Using OpenCV, they decreased memory usage, transformed\nRGB photos to grayscale, adjusted noise levels, and eliminated\nnoise.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn this study, we concentrated on the identification and\ntracking of Airplanes using real-time video, still photos, and\nimage data. The complete procedure is broken down into a\nnumber of subsections, which are demonstrated below:\nA. Dataset Preparation\nWhen using deep learning techniques to solve a problem,\ndata collection is the initial step. Data is required to identify\na problem\u2019s solution since deep learning techniques cannot\nfunction without it. Deep learning methods have an overfitting\ncondition when the dataset is too short, which prevents them\nfrom learning properly. Our objective is to detect and locate\nAirplanes from photos, videos, and webcam footage. We first\nneed an image dataset with Airplanes in it. We can gather\ninformation from a variety of sources. We obtained image\ndata from Roboflow for our investigation.Fig. 1 Samples of the\ndataset\u2019s images: We must label the dataset after it has been\nFig. 1: Samples of the dataset\u2019s images\ncollected. We are labeling the dataset with Roboflow annotator\ntools and standardizing label data files in XML annotation\nformat. The following set of labeled images includes some:\nThe collected images include a wide range of sizes, shapes,\nFig. 2: Samples of the labeled dataset\u2019s images\nand backgrounds. We are utilizing 2167 annotator XML files\nand 2167 colored Airplane images. The amount of data is\nadequate to guarantee diversity and comprehensiveness in\ntraining and testing.\nB. Images Preprocessing\nWe must preprocess the obtained images before training\nsince they have a wide range of forms, sizes, and backgrounds.\nThe images must be in a format that the algorithms we\u2019re\nutilizing can process. The images in the Roboflow dataset are\n416 x 416 in size. But 224 x 224 is the most suitable size\nfor image data for our models. Therefore, the images must be\ndownsized from 416 x 416 to 224 x 224. Then, we used the\nimread function to process the resized images. MATLAB\u2019s\nimage processing toolbox contains a function called imread\nthat reads an image file into a matrix. More specifically, it\nreads and saves in a matrix the pixel values from an image\nfile. After converting the images to arrays of pixel values, we\nmust scale the annotator values to correspond to the 224 x 224\nimage size. Our data is now prepared for training.\nFig. 3: A sample of a preprocessed image from 416 x 416 to\n224 x 224\nC. Models for Airplane Detection and Tracking\nWe chose seven object detection models and trained them\nwith our preprocessed data in order to detect and track\nAirplanes in images, videos, and real-time footage. We used\nMean Squared Error to monitor the accuracy and loss of the\nobject detection models throughout training. We complete our\nAirplane detection and tracking attempt using the model with\nthe highest accuracy and the least amount of loss. Here is a\ndemonstration of each of the four object detection models:\nVGG19 [4], ResNet50 [5], Xception [6], and MobileNetV2\n[7].\n1) VGG19: VGG19 [4] is a deep CNN model that consists\nof 19 layers, 16 of which are convolutional layers and 3 of\nwhich are fully connected layers. It has similar performance to\nVGG16 [4] and was trained on the ImageNet dataset; however,\nit contains more parameters. It has been extensively utilized\nfor image identification applications, serving as an inspiration\nfor several other deep CNN models, and has considerably\nadvanced computer vision.\n2) ResNet50: ResNet50 [5] is a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture that Microsoft Research unveiled in 2015.\nTo avoid disappearing gradients during training, it contains\n50 layers and is made up of residual blocks. State-of-the-art\nperformance has been attained on a variety of computer vision\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, object identification,\nand picture classification. It is typically utilized as a transfer\nlearning model that has already been trained.\n3) Xception: Franc\u00b8ois Chollet proposed the deep convo-\nlutional neural network architecture called Xception [6] in\n2016. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to increase\nperformance and efficiency. It has been extensively utilized\nfor a variety of computer vision applications, including posture\nestimation, segmentation, and object recognition. Additionally,\nit has the benefit of lowering computing costs and parameter\ncounts while retaining high accuracy, making it particularly ad-\nvantageous for embedded and mobile devices with constrained\ncomputational capabilities.\n4) MobileNetV2: Google researchers unveiled a deep con-\nvolutional neural network architecture called MobileNetV2 [7]\nin 2018. It is a modification of the first MobileNet architecture\nmade for portable and embedded devices with constrained\nprocessing capabilities. Inverted residual blocks are a unique\nblock structure that requires fewer parameters and calculations\nwhile maintaining good accuracy. It has attained cutting-\nedge performance on benchmarks for image classifica- tion\nand is frequently utilized as the framework architecture for\nmany computer vision tasks. In conclusion, MobileNetV2 [7]\nis a strong and effective deep learning architecture that is\nespecially beneficial for mobile and embedded devices with\nconstrained computational resources as well as for applications\nrequiring real-time performance.\nFrom the models that were above demonstrated, the Xcep-\ntion model outperformed others with the highest accuracy and\nthe lowest loss. Therefore, we will use this Xception model\nto achieve our drone detection goal.\nD. Airplane Detection and Tracking Process\nIn this study, Airplane detection was done using Airplane\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. The methods utilized\nfor Airplane detection differ based on the type of data being\nused. Below is an overview of the steps for each type of data:\n1) Airplane Detection from Images: Since our model was\ntrained on 224 x 224-size images, preprocessing the image to\nthat size is necessary before we can detect Airplanes from it. In\norder for the model to forecast the location of the Airplane , if\nthere is one, we must now load the desired model and provide\nthe image to the model. In some machine learning frameworks,\nsuch as Keras and TensorFlow, the predict function, a method\nfor making predictions on new data using a trained model,\nproduces the prediction. The rectangle function, which is a\ncomponent of the OpenCV library, a well-known computer\nvision library that offers tools and functions for a variety\nof image and video processing tasks, is now required to\ndistinguish the Airplane from the entire image. To draw a\nrectangle on an image, use the rectangle function. Last but\nnot least, we require the show function from the popular\nPython data visualization toolkit matplotlib in order to see the\ndetection and tracking. The matplotlib figures and graphs are\nall displayed using the show function. The general procedure\nis displayed below:\nFig. 4: Airplane Detection process from image\n2) Airplane Detection from Videos: We must scale the\nvideo to 224 x 224 in order to recognize Airplane from video\ndata because the model we want to use was trained on 224\nx 224 images. The video must now be split into numerous\npicture frames. After dividing the photo frames, we must load\nthe model and give it the appropriate photo frames. In some\nmachine learning frameworks, such as Keras and TensorFlow,\nthe predict function, a method for making predictions on new\ndata using a trained model, produces the prediction. Using\nthe rectangle function, the model will then create a rectangle\naround the Airplane and forecast its location based on those\nphoto frames. Following the prediction, the photo frames will\nbe converted to videos and then visualized with the help of\nthe show function. The general procedure is displayed below:\nFig. 5: Airplane Detection process from video\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur objective is to track and identify Airplanes using\nimages, videos, and real-time footage. Initially, we require a\ncollection of images that includes Airplanes. For this reason,\nwe obtained 2482 pictures from Roboflow. Our dataset was\nsplit into a training set and a testing set with a ratio of 0.9\nand 0.1, respectively. With a ratio of 0.7 and 0.2, the training\nset was further divided into the training and validation sets.\nHere is a breakdown of the splits:\nTABLE I: Summary of the Dataset\nDataset\nNo. of Images\nTraining Set\n1947\nValidation Set\n487\nTest Set\n48\nTotal\n2482\nWe also used 6 YouTube clips of varied lengths for testing\npurposes. After the dataset had been fully collected, we down-\nsized the picture data from different sizes to 224 x 224. The\nfollowing is an expression of the picture resizing formula:\nHere, \u03b3 is the scale factor, \u03b1 is the new width of the image,\n\u03b2 is the new height of the image, a and b are the original width\nand height of the image. After that, we adjusted the annotator\nvalues to fit the 224 x 224 image size using the following\nformula:\nHere, \u03bb is the new annotator value, x is the annotator value\nof the original image, and a is the original size of the image.\nA. Training Details\nIn order to identify and track Airplanes in photos, videos,\nand real-time recordings, we employed four pre-trained object\ndetection models of the TensorFlow object detection API. We\nused the Tesla T4 GPU from Google Collabs to train the\nmodels. Then, for running 100 epochs using weights from\nImageNet, we established the batch size of the data as 32.\nTo track the models\u2019 accuracy and loss, we used the mean\nsquared error. For improved learning, we employed the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. In the output layer, we\nemployed 1 fully connected dense layer with a linear activation\nfunction. In the beginning, while the epochs were running, we\ntrained the VGG19 model and kept an eye on its accuracy\nand loss calculation. The following are some illustrations of\ntraining epochs in which accuracy and loss improved:\nTABLE II: Performance Record for VGG19 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.77161\n857.0655\n2\n0.83555\n658.5710\n5\n0.89447\n756.2667\n23\n0.91051\n667.5093\n39\n0.92457\n558.7299\n55\n0.93605\n415.2966\n87\n0.94990\n164.1638\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see above, as epochs pass, the model\u2019s accuracy\nvalue increases and its loss value decreases. The final VGG19\nmodel accuracy was 95.82% with a loss of 136.3727. Accurate\nAirplane detection and precise Airplane position prediction\nrequire a high value for accuracy and a low value for loss. We\ntrained 3 more object detection models in order to increase\naccuracy and decrease loss. Next, we performed 100 training\nepochs on the MobileNetV2 model. The MobilenetV2 track\nrecord of performance is as follows:\nTABLE III: Performance Record for MobileNetV2 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.74123\n3849.8125\n5\n0.92882\n304.7950\n10\n0.93123\n194.9655\n22\n0.93274\n119.1886\n23\n0.96158\n114.8144\n39\n0.96281\n44.2283\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nThe accuracy of the MobileNetV2 model was 97.83%,\nwhich is greater than that of the VGG19 models, as demon-\nstrated above. The MobileNetV2 model loss was 37.4115,\nwhich is less than the VGG19 model. We further trained\nthe Resnet50 model to detect Airplane more precisely for\nthis reason. The Resnet50 track record of performance is as\nfollows:\nTABLE IV: Performance Record for ResNet50 Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.84599\n1516.615\n2\n0.89070\n288.6985\n5\n0.91687\n197.3536\n7\n0.94492\n219.1562\n23\n0.94942\n162.7735\n39\n0.95809\n66.6522\n62\n0.97661\n26.8935\n71\n0.9770\n22.778\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nAs we can see, the accuracy of the Resnet50 model was\n97.86%, with a loss of 20.8262 after training. Compared to\nearlier models, this time the accuracy and loss was lower.\nHowever, we wish to minimize the loss as much as we can.\nSo, in order to get the loss value we wanted, we trained our\nfinal object detection model, the Xception model. Below is a\nperformance history for the Xception model:\nTABLE V: Performance Record for Xception Model\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\n1\n0.6532\n4488.377\n2\n0.85291\n614.4808\n5\n0.92832\n280.1134\n21\n0.94220\n83.6525\n23\n0.96158\n81.1454\n39\n0.96805\n30.3848\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\n(a) Model Accuracy Graph\n(b) Model Loss Graph\nOur goal is to build a model with a high degree of accuracy\nand low loss. Low loss indicates that the anticipated output is\nquite close to the actual output, while high accuracy indicates\nthat the model is generally producing accurate predictions. We\ncan observe from the Xception model\u2019s performance record\ntable that it has the maximum accuracy of 98.59% and the\nlowest amount of loss at 15.9409. Comparing all the models\nwe have trained up to this point, the Xception model has\nthe best performance. We were able to detect and track the\nAirplane more precisely than previously with our model.\nConsequently, the Xception model outperformed all 4 of our\npre-trained object detection models.\nB. Comparison of Findings\nWe compared the outcomes after our 4 object detection\nmodels\u2019 training was successful. We compared the accuracy,\nloss, trainable parameters, IoU, picture frame division time,\nand other factors in this section. The following figures are\nrequired to show comparisons between the 4 models:\nTABLE VI: Comparison within all the applied models.\nModel\nEpoch\nTraining Accuracy\nTraining Loss\nXception\n55\n0.98590\n15.9409\nResNet50\n87\n0.97860\n20.8262\nMobileNetV2\n46\n0.97830\n37.4115\nVGG19\n92\n0.95818\n136.3727\nFig. 10: Comparison of Output between 4 Models\nFig. 13: Comparison of Accuracy between 4 Models\nFig. 11: Comparison of Trainable Parameters between 4 Mod-\nels\nFig. 12: Comparison of Loss between 4 Models\nC. Testing Details\n1) Texting from Image Data: After developing our model,\nwe evaluate how well it performs on the training set of\ndata. For testing purposes, we made use of pictures with\ndiverse backgrounds. If there are any airplanes in the image, a\nbounding box is shown around each one. The green bounding\nbox shows the actual bounding box values, while the red\nbounding box indicates the anticipated bounding box values\nsuggested by our models. Here are a few test outcomes:\nFig. 14: Test Outcome of Airplane from Images\n2) Texting from Video: For video data, drone detection and\ntracking are both performed. The drone must be continuously\ntracked because it moves continuously in videos. By dissecting\nthe footage into individual frames, the models are able to\nidentify and locate the drone. We divided the video into image\nframes by initially setting the FPS to 10. The following are\nsome examples of test results and the time required to divide\na picture frame:\nFig. 15: Test Outcome of Airplane from Video\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this research Four object detection algorithms were\ntrained in this study to find and track airplanes. Our model\nfared better than past work of the same kind. Due to the\nprevalence of airplane involvement in nefarious and urgent\ntasks, airplane identification is necessary. However, airplanes\nmight be difficult to spot at different altitudes due to their small\nsize, rapid speed, and high altitude. We offer many neural\nnetwork object detection models for tracking and detecting\nairplanes in this research. We trained and tested these models\nto determine how well deep learning works for tracking\nairplanes. We\u2019ll concentrate on developing efficient advanced\nobject detecting algorithms in subsequent work. When only\none drone is found, these models work effectively.
