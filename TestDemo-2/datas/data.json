Howard et al. MobileNet is a very efficient architecture, but it can sometimes sacrifice accuracy for efficiency. MobileNetV2 addresses this issue by using a depthwise separable convolution.\n\nA depthwise separable convolution is a type of convolution that is performed in two steps. First, a depthwise convolution is performed, which applies a convolution operation to each channel of the input image independently. This reduces the number of parameters and computational cost of the convolution operation. Second, a pointwise convolution is performed, which applies a convolution operation to the output of the depthwise convolution. This operation combines the output of the depthwise convolution into a single channel.\n\nThe use of a depthwise separable convolution in MobileNetV2 allows the network to achieve high accuracy while still being lightweight and efficient.
