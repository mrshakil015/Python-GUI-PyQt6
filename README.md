## Window Class Types
There are three different window type classes in PyQt6
  -  <strong>QMainWindow: </strong>The QMainWindow class provides a main application window  provides a framework for building an application's user interface. QMainWindow has its own layout to which we can add QToolBars, QDockWidgets, a QMenuBar, and a QStatusBar.
  -  <strong>QDialog: </strong> The QDialog class is the base class of dialog window and a dialog window is a top-level window mostly used for short-term tasks and brief communcation's with the user. QDialogs may be modal or modeless
  -  <strong>QWidget: </strong> The QWidget class is the base class of all user interface objects. The widget is an important point of the user interface: it receives the mouse, keyboard, and other events from the window system, and paints a representation of itself on the screen.
